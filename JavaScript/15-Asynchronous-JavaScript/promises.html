    <h1>Promises</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In JavaScript, a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out if the
        asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not.
        <br>
        A promise may have one of three states.

        <li>Pending</li>
        <li>Fulfilled</li>
        <li>Rejected</li>
        <br>
        A promise starts in a pending state. That means the process is not complete. If the operation is successful, the
        process ends in a fulfilled state. And, if an error occurs, the process ends in a rejected state.
        <br><br>
        For example, when you request data from the server by using a promise, it will be in a pending state. When the
        data arrives successfully, it will be in a fulfilled state. If an error occurs, then it will be in a rejected
        state.
