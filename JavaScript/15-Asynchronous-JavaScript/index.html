    <h1>Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task, and
        then rather than having to wait until that task has finished, to be able to continue to be responsive to other
        events while the task runs. Once the task is completed, your program is presented with the result.<br>

        Many functions provided by browsers, and especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time,
        and are therefore asynchronous. For example:

        <li>making HTTP requests with <code>fetch()</code>.</li>
        <li>accessing the user's camera or microphone with <code>getUserMedia()</code></li>
        <li>asking the user to select files for you to access using <code>showOpenFilePicker()</code></li>
    </p>
