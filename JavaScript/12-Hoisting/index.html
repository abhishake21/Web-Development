    <h1>Hoisting</h1>
    <p>
        Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared, except for function expression and
        arrow function.<br>They act as a variable and thus can't be hoisted giving you an initialization error.
    </p>
    <p>
        Class declarations are also hoisted, so they too can be referenced before they are declared.<br>
        In terms of variables and constants, keyword var is hoisted and let and const does not allow hoisting.<br>
