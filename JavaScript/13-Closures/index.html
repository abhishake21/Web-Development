    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <p>Function bundled with its lexical environment is known as a closure. Whenever function is returned, even if its
        vanished in execution context, it still remembers the reference it was pointing to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Closures are basically functions that can access values outside their own curly braces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever you return a function it returns with the values of its lexical scope.
