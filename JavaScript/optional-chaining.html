    <h1>Optional chaining (?.)</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The optional chaining operator enables you to read the value of a property located deep within a chain of
        connected objects without having to check that each reference in the chain is valid.
    </p>

    <p>
        The (?.) operator is like the (.) chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is
        nullish i.e null or undefined, the expression short-circuits with a return value of <strong>undefined</strong>.
        When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        In short optional chaining is a safe and concise way to perform access checks for nested object properties.
        In many practical cases we'd prefer to get undefined instead of an error.
