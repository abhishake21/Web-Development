    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <hr>
    Scope basically means where you can access variable or a function in our code. <br>
    <br>

    <p>When you just go ahead and create a variable in a javascript file, not inside of a function, not inside of a
        module, not inside of an if statement, when you create it out in the open, that is what is referred to as a
        <u><strong>Global variable</strong></u>
    </p><br>

    <p><u><strong>Block Scope</strong></u> - Whenever you have a set of curly brackets {...} like in the if statement,
        that is what is referred to as a block. If a variable is declared inside a code block, 
        its only visible inside that block. You can think of the brackets as gates. Those gates keep variables in.
    </p><br>

    <strong>let and const are block scope.</strong><br>
    <strong>var is function scope.</strong>
    <br><br>

    <p><u><strong>Function Scope</strong></u> is when variables are created inside of a function, those variables are
        only ever available
        inside of that function.
    </p><br>

    <p><u><strong>Lexical scope</strong></u> in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be
        accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration.
        But the opposite is not true; the variables defined inside a function will not be accessible
        outside that function.<br>
        In other words, an item's lexical scope is the place in which the item got created.
    </p><br>


    <p>Variables, if they are not found inside of a function, will go up a level higher and look for a variable in that
        scope. If it's not available in that scope, it will go up a level higher.
    </p>
