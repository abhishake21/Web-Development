    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <p>Classes are one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript.
        <br><br>
        A class is a blueprint for the object. You can create an object from the class.
        <br><br>
        You can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors,
        doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions, you build the house. House is the object.
        <br><br>
        Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.</p>
