    <h1>DOM</h1>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content
        of a document on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you write HTML and view it in the browser, the browser turns your HTML into something that is called the
        Document Object Model or the DOM.
        <br>
        That is what you see when you go to the elements panel in the browser developers tools on any website.
        <br>
        It is not actually just the HTML that you have written, it takes that, converts it to the Document Object Model,
        and it allows us to interface with the DOM via JavaScript.

        <li>We can do things like listen for clicks and scrolls.</li>
        <li>We can add, move, remove elements from that page or things like text, images, etc.</li>
        <li>We can add and remove CSS classes from elements which can trigger animations.</li>
        <li>We can fetch new data.</li>
        <li>We can play music and video.</li>
        <li>We can add any type of interaction to the page.</li>
        <br>
        and that is done by writing JavaScript that interfaces with the DOM (the things that are on the page, the
        elements on the page).
        <br><br>
        The DOM is represented in a tree that looks very much like HTML.
        <br>
        Even if you are using a framework like React, Angular or Vue, it's very helpful to understand that core concepts
        of the DOM like events, elements and classes, because they transcend all of the different frameworks.
        <br>
        Even if the frameworks help you do these things, you still need to know how it works under the hood.
