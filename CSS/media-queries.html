    <h1>Media Queries</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="main-info">Media queries let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics
        and parameters. They are a key component of Responsive design. For example, a media query can shrink the font
        size on small devices, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump
        up the size of buttons on touchscreens.
        <div class="points">
            Media queries can be used to check many things, such as - 
            <li>width and height of the viewport</li>
            <li>width and height of the device</li>
            <li>orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode)</li>
            <li>resolution</li>
        </div>

        <p class="other-info">
        Using media queries is a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets,
        and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).
